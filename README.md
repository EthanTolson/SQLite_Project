# Overview

{Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

I am using an SQLite database and am editing it using SQLite3 and Python. The database is empty as my program allows users to create tables and add values to those tables.
There should be no tables in the database for the reason listed above. My progrm allows users to create unconnected tables with up to 5 columns. They can choose the column names and types and enter whatever data they want.

# Development Environment

IDE: Visual Studio Code

Language: Python

Libraries: SQLlite, tkinter

# Useful Websites

* [TKinter Help](https://riptutorial.com/tkinter)
* [SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)
* [SQLite3 for Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)

# Future Work

* Fix the change item function to force types
* Add ability to join tables
